Remarks on what changes to modules are needed to make sure they can behave
in the 2.x source tree:

Exceptions
----------
- xarModApiFunc had a parameter to suppress exceptions. This parameter has
  been removed and an exception is always raised:
  Example:
  // don't throw an exception if this function doesn't exist (the zero at the end)
  $mytypes = xarModAPIFunc($modname,'user','getitemtypes', array(), 0);
  
  new code:
  try {
    $mytypes = xarModAPIFunc($modname,'user','getitemtypes');
  } catch (Exception $e) {
    $mtypes = array();
  }
