Notebook style scratch doc for the mail modules (created during
design/implementation of mail-in scenario) This document is roughly
conforming to the structured text format (stx) which will give people
who actually want pretty docs a head start. (google: stx2any for
details)  

! TODOLIST
* add xmlhttp stuff to the std. dd tags which generate the
  view/form/display screens, so in case the screen design is fit to do
  so, they can be used (also for commerce) 
* add property to the qdef object where you can specify how to store
  the queue items (sequence types as in the structures which triggered
  the implementation in the first place) 
* provide a usecase with some data 
* augment the new/create/view/modify/update standard functions with
  checks for the itemtype to validate whether we use our registered
  definition
* create entry point where the mta can pipe the mail content into
  (ws.php?)

! GENERAL 
The idea of the mail-in scenario was triggered by the implementation
of so called abstract datastructures for xaraya. Initially i started
with sequences, specialized into stacks, queues and deques. (see below
includes in the core repository for their specific meanings).
To be able to test these thouroughly i needed an application and
stumbled upon some TODOs in the mail modules, combined with my own
need for a mail interface to xaraya directly (trouble ticket system).

Based on that, the queue code was created in the mail module.

Coming from the above the work is roughly as follows:

Mail queues come in a couple of flavours:
# incoming 
  - get filled by something external to xaraya, usualy some mta like
  thing
  - get emptied by xaraya after processing is complete. The details
  for processing are somewhat subtle (see below)
# outgoing 
  - get filled by xaraya, typically something like a newsletter module
    or create notifications, etc.
  - get emptied by xaraya after processing is done.

There are some special types considered like a ''black hole'' which
would be a queue which never contains anything (visible) but still can
emit (radiate) or eat items. For now, we'll focus on incoming and
outgoing queues.

Typically a queue can be processed directly or on a scheduled
basis. If the queue is processed directly, it's not much of a queue in
practice because the items put into the queue are directly processed
and removed, so (assuming succesfull operation) the queue size is at
most one.
It gets more interesting if a queue is processed in a deferred manner,
either by a threshold parameter, or based on some schedule. 
* threshold: when a queue reaches a certain size/age the processing
  code kicks in and issues whatever is defined as the processing code
  for the queue
* scheduled: a process indepent on the (passive) xaraya process
  triggers an processing run, based on (external) parameter like time
  or load.    

# the process starts at an entry point where xaraya 'receives' mail
  through some mta magic routing the (raw) content of the mail item
  into xaraya.
# the mail modules receives this content and, based on some matching
  on headers or whatever, puts this into a specific queue for further
  processing by xaraya.
# by hooking other modules into the mail module a 'create' signal is
  generated whenever an item enters into some mail queue, which in
  turn allows the modules to do with the content whatever they
  please.
