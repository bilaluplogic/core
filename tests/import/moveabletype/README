This is the beginning of a migration utility for Moveable Type users.  
When complete, it will bring over all MT data, including trackback data.
At the moment, it is simply a set of renamed scripts derived from the 
Postnuke import utility.  In short, she don't work so don't try her!

PS:  I echo the sentiments of mikespub:

What you see is what you get :-)

In short, this means that the import script will not automagically import
things for you when there's no specific script that handles that part of
the data.

Contributions are welcome, of course...
