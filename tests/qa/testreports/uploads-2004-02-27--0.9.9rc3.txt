Tests done: 23
Tests passed: 22
Tests unsure: 0
Tests failed: 1

                 doing something wrong?)
Bugs reopened: 2238
Bugs closed: 2239, 2240

Environment:
   Linux / php 4.3.3 / mysql, and
   FreeBSD / php 4.3.2 / mysql
   xaraya-0.9.9rc3

Notes:
^^^^^^
  * Is Carl's work with the options in the validation field going to be included?
  * I couldn't get multiple uploads to work
  * Very impressed with upgrade :)

Uploads white box tests:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FileUpload (not hooked)
- input shows a single upload field + name of uploaded file (if any)
PASS

- uploads files to var/uploads or directory specified in the validation field
PASS

- accepted file types can be specified in the validation field
NOT TESTED. Had to dig into the code to find the format of this, and wonder
where the documentation for this feature should be?

- output shows a link to the file with its name
PASS

- value contains the filename
PASS

TextUpload (not hooked)
- input shows a text area + upload field
PASS

- uploads files and places their content in the text area
PASS

- output shows the text prepared for display
PASS

- value contains the original text
PASS


FileUpload (hooked)
- input shows upload sources + icons with link to uploaded files (if any)
PASS. The links for the different sources don't change the mouse to a hand when
we hover over them. At first I thought I was doing something wrong. I think
there is a css style that can fix this for us.

- upload functionality
   - upload source:
     - file is uploaded (may have scrambled filename)
     PASS on php 4.3.2. Failed silently on 4.1.2.

- file type functionality : handled by uploads permission
NOT TESTED

- output shows icons with link to uploaded files (templated)
FAIL, using the Downloads doctype all I see on the output is ;1 (applies for dd 
properties also):

http://roger0048.xarbsd.ninthave.net/xaraya-0.9.9rc3/html/index.php?module=articles&func=display&aid=6&ptid=8

However, when you click 'Edit' the forms show the icons properly.

- value contains the ;-separated list of file ids - can be used for
   custom info retrieval about the file(s) + custom presentation
PASS, except I was unable to figure out how to upload multiple files.

TextUpload (hooked)
- input shows a text area + upload sources
PASS

- uploads or selects uploaded files, and adds a "magic link" #ulid:NN# to
   them in the text area
PASS

- output shows the text - transform hooks will replace the magic links
   with icons and link to uploaded files (or whatever other information
   specified via #fileXYZ:NN#)
PASS

- value contains the original text before transformation
PASS

Upload (no hooks required)
- see FileUpload (hooked)
NOT TESTED

Basic functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* module installs
PASS

* modify config page displays
   * allowed real path in uploads directory
   * warning if bad path in uploads directory
NOT TESTED

* view uploads page displays
   * correct report of physical device space
NOT TESTED

* add file page displays
   * add file
   * import file into File system
   * import file into DB
NOT TESTED

Privileges
^^^^^^^^^^
NOT TESTED

Upgrading
^^^^^^^^^
After upgrading from 0.9.1.3, check:
  - each row from xar_uploads has an row in xar_file_entry
PASS

  - new xar_locations based on full path name of file
PASS, although on one database I used, I ended up with // in the path names.

  - userid copied to new table
PASS

  - old ulid matches new xar_fileentry_id
PASS. (Tested with two files though: fairly basic testing)

  - filesizes calculated
PASS

  - blobs from xar_uploadblobs now in xar_file_data
NOT TESTED

  - upgraded uploads have a mime type
PASS
