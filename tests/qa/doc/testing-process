 * Open the blank preflight checklist for the component using Mozilla
   Composer, or another suitable HTML editor. The blank checklists are in
   tests/qa/preflight/blank.

 * Save the blank checklist in tests/qa/preflight/complete with a unique
   filename that tells us information about the component, the tester and the  
   date or revision. e.g. installer-rkeays-0.9.10rc1.html

 * Run through each of the tests and record the results as either:

     PASS - test is successful as described
   
     PASS with NEW DEFECT (#x) - overall the test is successful, however there
     are still some issues with specific configurations/ platforms/
     environments, or a defect was discovered in another component of the
     product. Include the bugzilla number and add the defect summary to
     the section 'known defects / feature requests encountered'.
   
     PASS with KNOWN DEFECT (#x) - overall the test is successful, however there
     are still some known issues with specific configurations/ platforms/
     environments which have been submitted to bugzilla (might be marked
     RESOLVED/LATER, or RESOLVED/WONTFIX). Include the bugzilla number and add
     the defect summary to the section 'known defects / feature requests
     encountered'.

     PASS with NEW FEATURE REQUEST (#x) - the test passes successfully and
     inspired the tester to submit a new feature request. Include the new
     bugzilla number and add the feature request summary to the section 'new
     feature requests'.

     FAIL with KNOWN DEFECT (#x) - the test fails and has already been
     submitted to bugzilla. Include the bugzilla number and add the defect
     summary to the section 'known defects / feature requests encountered'.

     FAIL with NEW DEFECT (#x) - the test fails and a new defect has been
     submitted to bugzilla because of this. Include the new bugzilla number
     and add the defect summary to the section 'new defects'.

 * Do a search in bugzilla for defects for your component marked
   RESOLVED/FIXED. We want to go through this list and close as many of the
   defects as possible. You can only close defects you know have been fixed
   from the testing you did with the checklist.

   You can start at the top of the list, and whenever you close a defect
   you'll automatically be shown the next one in the list. Alternatively, you
   can use the 'next' link near the bottom of the page. For each defect you
   close, add it to the section in the preflight checklist 'Fixed defects
   marked closed'

 * add up the total of all the results for each of the tests and complete the
   summary table
