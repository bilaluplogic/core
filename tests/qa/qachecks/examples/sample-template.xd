 5.4.4 Hello #there# ! don't forget your dollar signs 
 inside #xarModAPI('template', 'tags')# !
/* template blah blah #$hello# is how you
   are supposed to do it, or you might be calling 
   a function like #xarModURL('base', 'user', 'main')#, the wrong
   way to do it is to just have #hello# without the dollar sign. */
