<h1>Xaraya BitKeeper QA Checks v0.2.0</h1>
<div style="text-align: right;"> <span class="xar-sub"> </span> </div>
<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Be able to calculate metrics such as<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li> # of tests passed (and which tests)</li>
    <li># of tests failed (and which tests)</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Portability: must be able to run on<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Linux</li>
    <li>Windows</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Modular tests:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to separate tests into different files instead of
maintaining a single script</li>
    <li>Ability to select which tests should be run</li>
    <li>Ability to run a set of tests<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Have 'fatal' and 'normal' tests</li>
  <li>Able to run same code for core and module repositories such that</li>
  <ul>
    <li>fail required tests prevent a push in the core, but not in
modules<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>too many failed recommended tests prevent a push in the core,
but not in modules<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Ability to run independantly of BitKeeper<br>
  </li>
  <li> Ability to execute a subset of tests on one or more files<br>
  </li>
  <li>Tests are numbered, and these numbers do not change once they are
checked in (if a test is deleted, no other test can use it's number)</li>
  <li>Maximize for speed<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Design</h2>
Some tests should just be a regexp that can be loaded by the engine.<br>
<br>
Would
like to be able to reuse the unit testing system, but not very familiar
with it. After considering this I think it is a bad idea mainly because
it would be very difficult to do regexp tests without parsing the file
over and over.<br>
<br>
Each test can become a class of either QACheck or
QARegExpCheck and then we have a custom engine to load and run the
tests. The engine needs accept the following command line options:<br>
<ul>
  <li>source filename(s)</li>
  <li>comma separated list of tests to run</li>
</ul>
The
engine always exits with error code 1 if unsuccessful. A wrapper script
in the modules and core repository can be responsible for deciding what
to do with the output (ie accept push or deny push).<br>
<br>
Test filenames can be used to give them numbers. e.g.
2.1.2-xarVarFetch.php.<br>
<br>
We use PHP for portability.<br>
