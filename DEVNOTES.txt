A log of important changes made to the 2.x branch which we need to
revisit later on before trusting the branch to be released or used.

DB-CHANGES:

- module_uservars is now module_itemvars where item is an item in a
  module, not only roles. The columns are adapted accordingly.
- hooks table now registers the mod id in the columns smodid and
  tmodid instead of the name of the module.
- adminpanels as module is completely gone, which also means its table
  was deleted. The complete functionality of adminpanels is now in the
  modules module.
- template_tags column xar_module replaced by a column xar_modid
- security_instances column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
- security_masks column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
- xar_roles column xar_auth_module replaced by column xar_auth_modid. The interface WAS NOT ADAPTED but nothing
  uses the auth_module directly and the columns is probably going to move away to somewhere else anyway.
- xar_block_types column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid. This was far out the most intrusive one since that table is used
  in the privilege instance queries. I adapted as best as I could, no doubt they wont work anymore in some cases. We'll see

OTHER CHANGES POSSIBLY AFFECTING UPGRADES:
- when encountered, upgrade code to upgrade modules from older
versions than in 1.0 are removed, assuming we will only support
upgrading from 1.0 to 2.x and not versions before 1.0
