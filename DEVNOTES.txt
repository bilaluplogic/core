A log of important changes made to the 2.x branch which we need to
revisit later on before trusting the branch to be released or used.

DB-CHANGES:

- module_uservars is now module_itemvars where item is an item in a
  module, not only roles. The columns are adapted accordingly.
- hooks table now registers the mod id in the columns smodid and
  tmodid instead of the name of the module.
- adminpanels as module is completely gone, which also means its table
  was deleted. The complete functionality of adminpanels is now in the
  modules module.

OTHER CHANGES POSSIBLY AFFECTING UPGRADES:
- when encountered, upgrade code to upgrade modules from older
versions than in 1.0 are removed, assuming we will only support
upgrading from 1.0 to 2.x and not versions before 1.0
